README v20110908

  This is the readme file for aurora project. aurora is a BSD licensed hybrid
  source code analyzer for security issues.

HISTORY

  It was the 3rd October 2006 and the Owasp Orizon project has begun. The goal
  was really challenging: building an open source static analyzer tool. I started
  thinking about using academic parser generator in order to build abstract
  syntax trees from the source code being scanned. This approach lead to a
  complexity bubble due the incredible amount of information retrieved from the
  sources from the parser generated using freecc or antlr.

  It was december 2010 and the Owasp Orizon project, after some year of hype
  wasn't update since months. So I decided to switch from Java to Ruby using the
  language I was writing webapps with.
  I called this project 'mirage' since it was a pure mirage to build a source
  code modeling engine and then to build a static analyzer.

  In spring 2011 I decided to gather some fresh ideas and energy and I declared
  as failed both mirage than Owasp Orizon projects and I started hacking around a
  2nd generation source code analyzer written in pure C using lex and yacc to
  build parsers for my source file.

  8 September 2011 I renamed the mirage project as 'aurora', thanks to ALOr
  (Alberto Ornaghi) for the great name suggestion and I moved to a far more
  interesting goal. Building an hybrid source code analyzer tool. Of course it
  will be a command line tool but when there will be something usable, I'll add a
  Ruby on Rails web app over it.
